You should collect (as inputs) each employee's name, hours worked, and hourly rate (3 variables x 3 employees = 9 variables). Also collect the tax rate which will be the same for all employees. Finally, print out a nicely formatted table that looks something like the one provided in the MyEducator assessment description.\n",

To keep it simple, this is not a marginal rate; ie, if they work over 40 hours a week, all 40 hours will be paid at the same rate. Use an `elif` condition for at least one employee and a nested `if` for at least one employee to demonstrate that both techniques can achieve the same outcome.
